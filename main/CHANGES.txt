# Branch: relaxation_bc
---

 - Added code in boundaries.c for applying a relaxation condition to tracers
 - Modified the netcdf time to allow a start at t=0
 - Fixed bug in the met netcdf time; the time step was out by 1
 - Updated EdgeMarkers() function based on Wenhao Chen's ticket #7 on Sourceforge

# Branch: variable_coriolis
---
 
 - Beta-plane code
 - Set parameter "betaplane" in suntans.dat
 - Calculates a spatially-variable coriolis term based on latitude
 - Reads in the variable "latv" from the initial condition netcdf
 - Requires "readinitialnc"
 - Uses the spatially variable latitude in the heat flux module for shortwave rad (met.c)
